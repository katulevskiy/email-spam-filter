# Summary of Changes

1. **Modularization**: 
   - Extracted the `print` statement into a separate function named `print_greeting`. This enhances readability by clearly defining what each part of the code is responsible for.
   
2. **Placeholders**:
   - Added a placeholder function `run_spam_filter` to simulate where future spam filtering logic would be implemented, making it clear that this module is intended to handle such functionality.

3. **Consistent Coding Standards**:
   - Ensured consistent use of docstrings and function definitions for better maintainability and readability.
   - Used meaningful names for functions to clearly convey their purpose.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Although the current logic is simple, structuring it in a modular way prepares the codebase for easier optimization as more complex functionality is added.

5. **Extensibility**:
   - The separation of concerns makes the code more extensible and easier to understand for future contributors.
