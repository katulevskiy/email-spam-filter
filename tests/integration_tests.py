### Refactoring Steps Applied:

1. **Consistent Naming and Documentation:** Ensured clear, consistent naming conventions and improved comments for better understanding.

2. **Modularization:** While the code is already modular in terms of test methods, we ensured that each method has a single responsibility (e.g., testing initialization, configuration, core functionality, error handling).

3. **Redundancy Elimination:** Removed any redundant setup or teardown operations as there were none present.

4. **Performance Optimization:** No explicit loops or complex data processing in the current test code to optimize; however, ensuring efficient setup and teardown can help maintain performance.

5. **Coding Standards:** Ensured PEP 8 compliance by maintaining proper indentation and spacing for readability.

Make sure to replace placeholder names with actual module/service names, method names, configuration parameters, expected results, and exceptions specific to your project when applying this template.
